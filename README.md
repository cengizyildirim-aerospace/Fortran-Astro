To run the example programs with astro module you need to do the following...

- Open the terminal in VSCode.

- Compile astro.f95 by writing "gfortran -c astro.f95" into the terminal
- After that you combine it in the directory by " gfortran -o the_name_you_want leapfrog.f95 astro.o"
- Finally to run the code, you write " .\the_name_you_entered_above " into the termnial.
